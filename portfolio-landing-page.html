    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Prior to enrolling for this sofware developmnt course, I attended University of Nairobi where I pursued a Bachelors Degree in Land Economics.
        I have worked in the real estate industry for about <strong>three</strong> <em>(3)</em> years.
    </p>
    <p> My interest in software developemnt was sparked by conversations I came across on Social Media <em>i.e. Twitter and Instagram</em> from other people in the tech space.
        This was further driven by the recognition that the world is continually evolving and the tech space is going to define how we live and how we interact with others in future.
        After much research, the Moringa School software development program stood out amongst the others and I therefore enrolled to the program.
