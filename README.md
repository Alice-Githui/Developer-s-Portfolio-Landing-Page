# Developer-s-Portfolio-Landing-Page
Contributors: Alice Githui
This repository is my developer's portfolio that aims to show the projects that I have created in the past. This website showcases my skills and my current abilities. This website was created using HTML and CSS technologies where HTML created the content of the page and the CSS styled the page to create my desired outlook which is simple to navigate and communicates to the readers. 

In case of any questions, you can reach me on Slack @Alice Githui
